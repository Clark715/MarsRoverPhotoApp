# MarsRoverPhotoApp
Created by: Colby Clark

A simple app that communicates with a NASA API that retrieves photos from the Curiosity Rover currently on Mars.
The app allows the user to choose any date between when the rover landed on Mars and present, and allows a selection of different camera views.

Some dates may give an error using certain dates where no photos were taken and/or uploaded, or if there are no available photos for the selected
camera view.

An error may also occur if the app is unable to communicate with the API correctly.
